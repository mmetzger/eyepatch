EyePatch is a Cocoa based tool to Enable / Disable the built-in iSight camera on Leopard / Snow Leopard / Lion based machines (will not work with Tiger.)  

The tool works by changing the permissions on up to four files:

(Leopard & above)
/System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component/Contents/MacOS/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServicesPrivate.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC
(Snow Leopard & above)
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC
(Lion)
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMediaIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC
