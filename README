EyePatch is a Cocoa based tool to Enable / Disable the built-in iSight camera on Leopard / Snow Leopard based machines (will not work with Tiger.)  

The tool works by changing the permissions on two files:

/System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component/Contents/MacOS/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServicesPrivate.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC

If you're using Snow Leopard, it will also update permissions on:

/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC

Thanks to techslaves.org for the original inspiration for this tool
